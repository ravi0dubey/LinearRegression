# LinearRegression for Advertising


We are Testing our Data set based on Features **TV**, **Radio** and **Newspaper** to study the impact on **Sales** and deriving the accuracy of the Model </br>

# Result of the Model

If we take just**TV** as the feature then we get Model accuracy of **81%** </br>

But if we add Newspaper and Radio along with TV then accuracy increases </br>

But we also see, based on the Result, there is no difference in adding **Newspaper** to our model as it hardly shows any contribution </br>

We are getting **90.26%** under both scenarios </br>

# Conclusion
We can include TV and Radio to determine Sales</br>
